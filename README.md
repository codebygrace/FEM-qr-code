## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I plan to come back to this project and make it fully responsive so that it adjusts with several different screen sizes, including tablet sizes. I also plan to possibly make some design updates just for fun.
